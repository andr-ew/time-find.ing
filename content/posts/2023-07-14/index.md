didn't think i had captured it at first, but found a blurry snippet of evidence upon looking back â€” a single firefly, amidst a gathering of blinking traffic barriers. can't help but wonder if they (the firefly) were searching for a mate, or at least some company w/ familiar souls <3

sounds made with norns scrips: jhnn, ndls + a korg minilogue

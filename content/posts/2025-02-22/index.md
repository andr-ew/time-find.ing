description: no ice is not nice
---
tried leaving the house for a singular winter timeâ€“finding excursion because jade showed me some tik-toks of what ice melting over lake michigan looks/sounds like, but alas, despite monitoring the weather on the day I choose the lake was definitively unfrozen. so, just a shitty recording of me smooshing the ice _next_ to the lake + random shouting children. but I rode my bike / touched grass = mission accomplished. 

coincidentally I recently learned from a comment on an excelent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgkTj7yq0QQ) about what the game skyrim would feed like in real life that ice doesn't freeze over a lake until it's well below freezing point, so there ya go.
